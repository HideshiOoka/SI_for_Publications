## Overview
The (python) codes used in my published papers will be uploaded to this directory. If anyone is interested, they are welcome to change parameters and play around with the code. If there are any inquiries, please send them to my @riken.jp email address which can be found in the corresponding author information of my papers.

- 2023 Nature Communications: Numerical simulations of enzyme volcano plots. 
- 2021 ACS Catal: Fitting algorithm of Tafel plots. The code works but it is dirty. I hope to someday make a version 2 with cleaner code.
